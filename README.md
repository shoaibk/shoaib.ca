## shoaib.ca

This is the source code of my [personal site](http://shoaib.ca). It is just a single responsive page that has some text and a bunch of external links.

The project was built using the [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/),
so the build system is [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). To build the site (which gets output in the
`dist` folder), just run

    gulp
    
After build is complete, you can just copy the contents of the `dist` folder to your hosting server.
